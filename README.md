# HackathonQ4US
SCE Hackathon Project

A Project for the ISTAQ SCE Hackathon:
- Manages and recgonizes two or more Arduino Devices
- Upon Connection of the devices, a quiz is enabled for the participants to play on the machine (Preferably a Tablet)

The General Mission of the Project was to connect between diverse cultures in Israel, through initiating a conversation among them in a creative way.
The Arduino IoT Devices are integrated into Bracelets which can be produced at a low cost due to the use of a simple Arduino Module.
